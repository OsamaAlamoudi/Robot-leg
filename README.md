# Robot-leg
I designed a model for the bottom of the robot by using cinema 4d R20. As shown on "robot_leg_desgin" file the model length is 64 cm and its width 50 cm.
From the top the thickness of the waist is 9 cm. It's connected to the joint by a 7 cm arm. Then the first joint and second joint are connected by a 14 cm arm. And the arm connects between the foot and the second joint, its length 13 cm.

# Angle calculation 
Calculate the maximum angle of foot movement by using tan law which: tanùû±=opposite/adjacent. Where the opposite equal 55 cm and the adjacent equal 64 cm, after using the tan law with this numbers we will got the angle that the robot can move its foot (ùû±=40.67 degree)
